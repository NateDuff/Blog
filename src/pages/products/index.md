        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about

      Doctor P is the MAN! Extremely personable and compassionate while maintaining professionalism. His staff are courteous as they are kind, friendly, and absolutely delightful. If you're looking for a physician who far surpasses the emotionally absent "doctors" who only see you as a list of symptoms or medications, he's your man.

      Wonderful doctor.  I can't say enough good about him. Was seeing another internist for years. In the mid 90's I started to notice fatique and progressively getting worse. Was checked by my primary physician at the time.  He did no testing  I knew something was very wrong so I found and saw Dr Pirzada.  On that first appointment he checked for Lupus in  blood work, found I was "borderline" for Systemic Lupus at which time he sent me to a Rheumatologist. The Rheumatologist performed the very specific blood work and came back as SLE Systemic Lupus,  and confirmed.  I am forever in Dr Pirzada's debt  He's truly a caring and kind physician. I would refer anyone to him. Half of my family sees him now too.

      Very nice and cordial, listen sincerely my concerns and take time to explain. Encouraging to go with natural way to cure instead of prescribe crazy dosage of medicine. Effective and practical. I just approached this Dr for just a basic physical exam, but his approach and effectiveness made me to accept him as my primary care physician.

      Dr. Prizada is so caring and personable. Best primary doctor I've had, hands down.  He takes his time talking with you, doesn't rush. He genuinely cares about his patients. I highly recommend him!
